---Point Breakdown---
S-Tier:
    simultaneous two-player mode: 50 points

    new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits: 25 points
Novice Tier:
    display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen: 15 points
Starting Tier:
    speed increase that happens after 30 seconds in the original game: 10 points
    allow the player to control the Rocket after it's fired: 10 points
Final Score: 110/100
I know I can't go over 100 but I forgot the timer was on the list so I went over by accident
